                <div class="question">How does collective buying power actually change healthcare?<span class="toggle-icon"></span></div>
                <div class="answer">
                    One person asking for a prescription discount: Insurance company says no. They have all the power.<br><br>
                    244 million people buying together through Mark Cuban's platform: Insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies have no choice but to negotiate. WE set the prices.<br><br>
                    Right now, you negotiate as an individual against billion-dollar corporations. You lose. PHIERS changes that. You negotiate as 244 million people collectively. You win. That's not just lower prices. That's shifting the power balance entirely.

                <div class="answer">
                    Mark Cuban's Cost Plus is already operational (since 2022) at 200+ pharmacies. It's proving that collective purchasing power delivers 80-90% prescription savings. We're not inventing this. We're scaling what already works. His infrastructure + our collective buying power = $80-90/month savings per person. That's the foundation that funds everything else.

                <div class="question">How much will I actually save on healthcare per month?<span class="toggle-icon"></span></div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <strong>Average savings breakdown:</strong><br><br>
                    Prescription savings (collective buying): $80-90/month<br>
                    Telehealth insurance cost: $50/month<br>
                    Your cost: $0 (savings cover insurance)<br>
                    Extra savings per month: $30-40<br><br>
                    Plus: $833/month Universal Basic Income (from collective surplus)<br>
                    Plus: Access to millions of AI-resistant jobs<br><br>
                    <strong>For a family of four:</strong><br>
                    Prescription savings: $240-300/month<br>
                    Family telehealth insurance: $100/month (family plan)<br>
                    Your family cost: $0<br>
                    Extra family savings: $140-200/month<br><br>
                    Plus: $3,332/month in combined UBI ($833 × 4 people)<br><br>
                    This isn't theoretical. This is immediate, measurable relief for people hurting right now.

                <div class="question">What about people with complex medical needs or chronic diseases?<span class="toggle-icon"></span></div>
                <div class="answer">
                    PHIERS is designed for the 80% of people who don't need hospitalization. For people with serious chronic diseases, complex conditions, or who need specialists:<br><br>
                    1. Keep your traditional insurance if you want it<br>
                    2. Your collective savings from the $2.73T still benefit you (through UBI + jobs + safety net)<br>
                    3. As the system scales, we can afford to offer expanded hospital coverage<br>
                    4. But you're never forced out of care you need<br><br>
                    The beauty is: affordable healthcare (PHIERS) + comprehensive safety net = everyone's covered, either through PHIERS or through supplemental options funded by collective savings.

                <div class="question">How does this help if I'm already in medical debt?<span class="toggle-icon"></span></div>
                <div class="answer">
                    $833/month UBI directly goes to debt payment. For someone in $20K medical debt, that's 24 months of direct payment ($19,992). Plus telehealth insurance eliminates future healthcare costs. Plus you regain employment opportunity (PHIERSWorks jobs). Within 2 years, medical debt is eliminated. Going forward, you're protected from future medical bankruptcy.

        <!-- THE MECHANISM -->
        <div class="faq-category">
            <h2>⚙️ How The Self-Sustaining Loop Works</h2>
            
            <div class="faq-item" onclick="toggleFAQ(this)">
                <div class="question">How does the system keep growing without government intervention?<span class="toggle-icon"></span></div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Step 1: You join, save $80-90/month on prescriptions through collective buying<br>
                    Step 2: Your $50 insurance is covered by your savings. You have $30-40 surplus<br>
                    Step 3: Your $30-40 surplus funds insurance for someone just joining (they've joined for prescriptions, not insurance yet)<br>
                    Step 4: That person's surplus funds the next person<br>
                    Step 5: System grows exponentially. Each new person funds the next person's insurance.<br>
                    Step 6: Collective power increases. More people = more negotiating leverage = even better prices<br>
                    Step 7: Better prices = more surplus for jobs, UBI, safety net<br><br>
                    This isn't dependent on taxes, government, or legislation. It's self-sustaining mathematics. Each person joining makes the system stronger for the next person. Classic positive feedback loop.

                <div class="question">What happens if enrollment slows down?<span class="toggle-icon"></span></div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Enrollment won't slow down because the value proposition is too strong. When premiums DOUBLE on January 1st (which they will), people facing $250+/month premiums will choose $0 premiums through PHIERS. The crisis creates urgency. The proof eliminates doubt. Enrollment accelerates, not slows.

            <div class="faq-item" onclick="toggleFAQ(this)">
                <div class="question">What happens to SNAP, housing assistance, childcare, and other safety net programs?<span class="toggle-icon"></span></div>
                <div class="answer">
                    The $2.73 trillion in collective savings fully funds:<br><br>
                    • SNAP (food assistance) - fully funded, no work requirements<br>
                    • Housing assistance - fully funded, covers rent/mortgage gaps<br>
                    • Childcare - fully funded, enables workforce participation<br>
                    • Education - fully funded, from pre-K through college<br>
                    • Emergency aid - fully funded, for health crises, job loss, natural disasters<br>
                    • Healthcare safety net - fully funded, for people needing hospitals<br><br>
                    DOGE wants to cut these programs. PHIERS funds them at higher levels than today. This isn't theoretical—the math directly shows how $2.73T redirected from corporate extraction funds all of this.<br><br>
                    The key difference: funded by collective buying power (not taxes), distributed through cooperation (not bureaucracy), and politically untouchable (because disrupting it means losing 27K voters in your district).

                <div class="answer">
                    PHIERSWorks creates millions of AI-resistant jobs funded by collective healthcare savings:<br><br>
                    Healthcare support: Home health aides, community health workers, patient advocates<br>
                    Community services: Childcare providers, elder care, mentorship programs<br>
                    Food security: Community gardens, food distribution, nutrition programs<br>
                    Housing: Weatherization, repairs, maintenance, infrastructure<br>
                    Education: Tutoring, mentorship, youth programs<br>
                    Infrastructure: Roads, bridges, community facilities<br>
                    Communication: Local coordinators, organizers, movement builders<br><br>
                    All pay $18-40/hour (living wages), all directly improve community health and wellbeing, all are impossible to automate. These aren't make-work. These are essential human services that improve lives while keeping people employed.

        <!-- POLITICAL LEVERAGE -->
        <div class="faq-category">
            <h2>🏛️ Why This Becomes Inevitable</h2>
            
            <div class="faq-item" onclick="toggleFAQ(this)">
                <div class="question">How does 3.5% political threshold actually work?<span class="toggle-icon"></span></div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Harvard researcher Erica Chenoweth studied 323 political movements. Result: When 3.5% of a population actively supports a movement, it ALWAYS succeeds. Always.<br><br>
                    For Congress: 3.5% of people in your district saying "adopt PHIERS or we primary you" = political inevitability<br><br>
                    Why it works:<br>
                    • Primaries are how politicians get replaced (not general elections)<br>
                    • 3.5% voters in a district is HUGE primary influence<br>
                    • Politicians fear primaries more than losing general elections<br>
                    • 3.5% votes is often enough to determine primary outcomes<br><br>
                    Once 3.5% threshold is hit in multiple districts, politicians have no choice. Support PHIERS or be primaried. Simple math. No escape.

                    • Customer choice (patients pick their healthcare)<br>
                    • MASSIVE spending cuts ($2.73T eliminated from corporate extraction)<br>

                <div class="answer">
                    ACA subsidies expire. Premiums DOUBLE for 22 million Americans. Average couple earning $44K faces premium increase from $85→$253/month. That's $168/month pain. That's $2,016/year in new costs AFTER already struggling with inflation, tariffs, shrinkflation.<br><br>
                    That pain is MAXIMUM MOTIVATION. When people are desperate, they'll try something new. When they see collective buying power works, they'll join. The crisis accelerates PHIERS growth.

                    2. TECHNOLOGY: Telehealth had to become mainstream/trusted (done) ✓<br>
                    3. CRISIS: The problem had to become undeniable (Congress just failed) ✓<br><br>
                    All three conditions are NOW met. Will Price researched this for many years, waiting for perfect timing. That moment is now. Not a day too early. Not a day too late.

                    They won't. Here's why: Mark Cuban's model proves they have no choice. When 244 million people say "we're buying through this channel or not at all," pharmaceutical companies negotiate. It's basic economics. Lose 40% of your market (244M people) or negotiate better prices. They choose negotiation.

                    They won't. Once 3.5% threshold is hit, primary challengers emerge automatically. "My opponent refuses to support healthcare that saves you $7,900/year. I will." Primary voters choose the supporter. Politician is replaced. No escape.

                <div class="answer">
                    Healthcare needs don't go away in recessions. People STILL need prescriptions, telehealth, jobs, food, housing. PHIERS becomes even MORE essential. Economic crisis = maximum need for PHIERS. The system strengthens, not weakens.
