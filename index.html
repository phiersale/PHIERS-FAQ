        <!-- BREAKTHROUGH MECHANISM -->
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">How does the Rx→telehealth breakthrough loop work?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>This is the engine that makes PHIERS possible.</strong></p>
                
                <p>Every $50 saved on prescriptions (through Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drug Company, which achieves 80-90% savings) funds the replacement of traditional insurance with telehealth coverage:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Traditional insurance costs:</strong> $8,000/year individual, $24,000/year families</li>
                    <li><strong>Telehealth coverage costs:</strong> $600/year (for BOTH individuals AND families)</li>
                    <li><strong>Savings per substitution:</strong> $7,400 individual, $23,400 family</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>The Positive Reinforcement Loop:</strong></p>
                
                <p>Each substitution generates <em>thousands</em> in additional savings. Those savings fund MORE substitutions. Each new substitution creates MORE savings. This compounds rapidly.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Who this works for:</strong> 80% of Americans with public or private insurance don't need hospitalization or specialty care in a given year. They can use telehealth. That's why <span class="highlight">hundreds of millions will eventually join us</span>.</p>
                
                <p>This isn't theory. Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drug Company serves 7 million customers RIGHT NOW with proven 80-90% prescription savings since 2022.</p>

        <!-- WINTER BREAK URGENCY -->
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Why is timing so urgent right now?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <div class="urgent-box">
                    <p><strong>Congress is on winter break RIGHT NOW (through December 31st)</strong> and supposed to be accessible to constituents.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p><strong>Three simultaneous forcing functions:</strong></p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>December 31, 2025:</strong> Enhanced ACA subsidies expire. Premiums MORE THAN DOUBLE (114% increase from $888 to $1,904/year) for 22 million Americans starting January 1st.</li>
                    <li><strong>Winter break accessibility:</strong> Representatives home in districts, vulnerable to constituent pressure at town halls and local events.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prevention window:</strong> If we act fast enough and go VIRAL, we can actually PREVENT the healthcare cost spike entirely.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>The sooner people join the movement, the sooner we can hold Congress accountable for DIFFERENT decisions, BETTER decisions.</strong></p>
                
                <p>This isn't just about responding to the crisis—we can <em>stop it from happening</em> if we mobilize quickly enough. But we have 15 days.</p>

        <!-- WHO IS WILL PRICE -->
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Who is Will Price and why should I trust him?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
                
                <p>Will Price has always been a public health advocate, working on solutions to strengthen the safety net. When his mentor and supporter became ill, he became their live-in caregiver.</p>
                
                <p>He witnessed abuse and endangerment. When he asked questions and protested, he was ejected from his position. That's how he became homeless.</p>
                
                <p>But he continues fighting for the solution he and his mentor started together—the solution that will help hundreds of millions of Americans.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Proven Predictive Accuracy:</strong></p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Published concepts behind Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drug Company in 2014—<em>years before Cuban launched</em></li>
                    <li>Published concepts behind ZORTT Healthcare Cooperative in 2014—<em>years before they became operational</em></li>
                    <li>Videos and documentation going back decades proving track record</li>
                    <li>LinkedIn profile: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-price-5801434/" target="_blank">linkedin.com/in/will-price-5801434</a></li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Why trust him?</strong> His homelessness proves he's not in this for money. If he wanted profit, he could have walked away and pursued easier, more lucrative work. Instead, he chose principles over comfort, truth over safety, and the many over the few.</p>
                
                <p>He publishes everything publicly so others can prove his concepts work while he continues focusing on emerging threats. He's a 5D problem solver who can see what others see but solve problems no one else can solve.</p>

                <p><strong>At 3.5% participation (Erica Chenoweth's threshold for guaranteed systemic change), we have mathematical leverage politicians cannot escape.</strong></p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>✅ Adopt PHIERS:</strong> Deliver $1.95+ billion in district savings, be celebrated as heroes who served constituents over corporate donors</li>
                    <li><strong>⚠️ Show us something better:</strong> Present an alternative that delivers equivalent savings and benefits. We'll consider it honestly.</li>

                <p><strong>The consequences:</strong></p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Primary challenges:</strong> Funded by cooperative savings with candidates committed to delivering what voters demand</li>
                    <li><strong>Special elections:</strong> If it's obvious representatives are crooked and working AGAINST constituents, we can launch special elections BEFORE the 2026 general election</li>
                    <li><strong>Permanent accountability record:</strong> Survey data creates publicly-tracked database of what voters actually want vs. how representatives vote</li>

            <div class="answer">
                <p>The Trump administration is destroying 30,000 Veterans Affairs jobs (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/13/trump-us-veterans-affairs-plans-job-cuts-washington-post.html" target="_blank">source: CNBC</a>).</p>
                
                <p><strong>PHIERS can absorb these displaced workers</strong> into AI-resistant community health roles:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Community health workers</li>
                    <li>Home health aides</li>
                    <li>Mental health counselors</li>

                </ul>
                
                <p>These are exactly the jobs PHIERS creates—AI-resistant positions requiring human judgment, funded by healthcare cooperative savings.</p>
                
                <p><strong>This honors our commitment to veterans</strong> while strengthening the safety net for all Americans. When the government breaks promises, cooperative economics keeps them.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Potentially next week</strong> if the article publishes and people sign up</li>

                <p>Once we have negotiating power through petition signatures and membership, Mark Cuban and ZORTT will appreciate the traffic we drive to their platforms. This makes us worthy of:</p>

            <div class="question">What if I get in an accident or have a medical emergency?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Honest answer: Risk pathways and your choices.</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>PHIERS telehealth ($600/year) covers:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Primary care consultations</li>
                    <li>Prescription management (with Cuban Cost Plus savings)</li>
                    <li>Mental health services</li>
                    <li>Preventive care guidance</li>
                    <li>Chronic condition management</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>What it doesn't cover:</strong> Emergency hospitalization, surgery, specialty procedures requiring facility care.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Your risk management options:</strong></p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Pure telehealth ($600/year):</strong> Accept emergency risk, save $7,400+ annually. If emergency occurs, negotiate payment plans or apply for hospital charity care.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Catastrophic coverage add-on:</strong> Keep high-deductible emergency insurance ($2,000-3,000/year) + PHIERS telehealth. Still save $4,000-5,000/year vs. traditional insurance.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Traditional insurance (for high-risk individuals):</strong> If you have chronic conditions requiring hospitalization, keep traditional coverage. PHIERS savings from others subsidize YOUR premiums at scale.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p><strong>At 3.5% participation:</strong> Cooperative savings are large enough to subsidize traditional insurance for people who genuinely need it. The 80% who don't need hospitalization fund coverage for the 20% who do.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Your choice:</strong> Evaluate your health status, risk tolerance, and savings priorities. PHIERS gives options—it's not one-size-fits-all.</p>

        <!-- IS THIS SOCIALISM -->
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Is this socialism?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>No. This is cooperative capitalism.</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>What PHIERS is:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Member-owned cooperative (like credit unions, REI, agricultural co-ops)</li>
                    <li>You own your share</li>
                    <li>Profits return to members, not shareholders</li>
                    <li>Free market competition forces better service</li>
                    <li>Zero government ownership or control</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>What PHIERS is NOT:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Government-run healthcare</li>
                    <li>Single-payer system</li>
                    <li>Tax-funded program</li>
                    <li>Mandated participation</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>This is as American as apple pie.</strong> Cooperatives have existed in America for over 100 years. They represent free association, voluntary participation, and democratic member control.</p>
                
                <p>The difference between cooperatives and corporations: cooperatives prioritize member benefit over shareholder profit. That's capitalism serving people instead of extracting from them.</p>

            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Will's entire adult career has been dedicated to solving these problems, with videos and documentation going back decades.</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>Why established organizations haven't solved this:</strong></p>
                
                <p>Will and his team have been pursued by, partnered with, and then <em>sabotaged</em> by health systems, insurance plans, pharmaceutical companies, and professional associations when they realized PHIERS would eliminate the profit motive in healthcare.</p>
                
                <p>They wouldn't get rich with these ideas, so they killed partnerships.</p>
                
                <p><strong>That's why Will publishes everything publicly</strong>—so others can prove his concepts work (like Cuban and ZORTT did) while he continues focusing on emerging threats.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Established organizations:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Move slowly (bureaucracy, committees, approvals)</li>
                    <li>Compromise constantly (donors, board members, corporate interests)</li>
                    <li>Answer to funders, not members</li>
                    <li>Avoid disrupting profitable systems</li>
                </ul>
